that pen and never use it. If you work consecutively m-1 hour, then at the mth hour you will be rewarded a new pen.
Formally you will get a new pen at every (i * m)th (i > 0) hour. How many hours you have to work until you go back to
sleep. You’ll go back to sleep when you have no more new pen to write. Print the maximum no of hours you’ll have
to work. If there’s no way you’ll be able to sleep at all, print "No Sleep" as the output.
