Maximum Assignment at a Time

Another name of IIITD is "deadline". As you all know IIITDâ€™s life is a very busy life with lots of assignments and
deadlines. You are also a student of IIITD and you know sometimes there are lots of assignments at the same time
and it is not possible to do all the assignments. So, your task is to design an algorithm to choose the maximum
number of assignments that can be done at a time.

Input
The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case the first line consists
of an integer N, the number of activities. Then the next N lines contains two integers m and n, the start
and end time of each activity.
*  1 <= T <=10
*  1 <= N <= 100000
*  0 <= start < end <= 1000000

Output
For each test case find the maximum number of assignments that you can do.
